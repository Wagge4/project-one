      <h1>What is my story and how did I get money as my interest?</h1>
        <p>
           My story with money started when I was very young. It all 
           started when I first played Super Mario on my mothers Nintendo,
           where I loved collecting as many coins as I possibly could.<br>
           Later on I started playing Minecraft, where I collected every single
           item as much as possible just because I loved the challenge in 
           grinding up as many items as I could.<br>
           After this I started collecting stuff in real life.<br>
           I collected almost everything, all from capsules, to football and 
           pokemon cards, to drink cans.<br>
           When I grew a little older and got a feel for money, it just came
           natural to me to enjoy the topic money. All from making as much as I can,
           to just spreading my knowledge regarding the topic.<br>
           This is why I today proudly present my services to you, so that you
           can have a great journey with money too!
