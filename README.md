<h2>Gallery</h2>
<li>The gallery is an important page, as it shows the user that there are many different ways to make money out there, but instead of describing that to them in text form I do it using the gallery page in images.</li>

<h2>Features left to implement</h2>
<li>When the site has grown in popularity I'm looking to make a signup page where people can sign up with a username and password, and have our own friendly community where the users can discuss ideas of their own with each other.</li>


<h1>Testing</h1>
There has been a lot of testing done to the website, and it is now working as intended, after lots of bug fixing.
I faced a lot of bugs regarding GitHub. For example when I one day tried to push the save to GitHub and I got an error, and the solution to it was to restart the workspace. I thought that was a strange bug.
