<h2>The footer</h2>
<li>The footer section includes links to my social medias, and the clickable links are icons as the symbol of each social media instead of boring text.</li>

<li>The gallery is an important page, as it shows the user that there are many different ways to make money out there, but instead of describing that to them in text form I do it using the gallery page in images.</li>

<h2>Features left to implement</h2>
<li>When the site has grown in popularity I'm looking to make a signup page where people can sign up with a username and password, and have our own friendly community where the users can discuss ideas of their own with each other.</li>


<h1>Testing</h1>
There has been a lot of testing done to the website, and it is now working as intended, after lots of bug fixing.
I faced a lot of bugs regarding GitHub. For example when I one day tried to push the save to GitHub and I got an error, and the solution to it was to restart the workspace. I thought that was a strange bug.
There was also a bug where I could not open port 8000 to see my live progress in a browser, all it said was "Failed to expose". I called the tutor for help after trying for a long time to solve it myself, both by help from Google and from my Slack friends. It turned out that it was just GitPod playing games for some reason, and all I had to do was to add "8000" to my existing URL and it worked. That was also strange to me.
Of course I had a lot of problems with missing one letter here and there, which broke the page, but that's fixed with a quick overview of the code so those problems are no big deal.
